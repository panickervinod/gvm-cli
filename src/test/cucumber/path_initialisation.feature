Feature: Path Initialisation

  Background:
    Given the internet is reachable
    And an initialised environment

  Scenario: sdkman is initialised for the first time
    Given the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is already installed and default
    And the system is bootstrapped
    When I enter "echo $PATH"
    Then I see a single occurrence of "grails"

  Scenario: sdkman is initialised a subsequent time
    Given the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is already installed and default
    And the system is bootstrapped
    And the system is bootstrapped again
    And I enter "echo $PATH"
    Then I see a single occurrence of "grails"

  Scenario: Install a candidate and see it on the PATH
    Given the system is bootstrapped
    When I enter "echo $PATH"
    Then I see no occurrences of "grails"

  Scenario: Install a candidate and see it on the PATH
    And the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is available for download
    And the system is bootstrapped
    And I enter "sdk install grails 2.1.0" and answer "Y"
    When I enter "echo $PATH"
    Then I see a single occurrence of "grails"

  Scenario: Install multiple candidate versions and see it once on the PATH
    Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is available for download
    And the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is available for download
    And the system is bootstrapped
    And I enter "sdk install grails 1.3.9" and answer "Y"
    And I enter "sdk install grails 2.1.0" and answer "Y"
    When I enter "echo $PATH"
    Then I see a single occurrence of "grails"
